# ZombieDash

*** Score: 100/100

This project implements an interactive, map-based game in which the user leads "civilians" to safety from "zombies." The user can heal itself and kill zombies using power-ups which are picked up throughout the map. This project is implemented with **C++** and uses XQuartz for graphics. 

I was tasked with coming up with a logical class hierarchy as well as associated data structures, as well as implementing the functionality of each of the characters in the game. This project utilized almost all the concepts from this class, such as object-oriented programming, class hierarchy, proper C++ structure, etc. 

More details on the implementation, as well as testing procedures, are documented in report.txt. 

This was my year's legendary Project 3 for UCLA's CS 32 -- Introduction to Computer Science II (Data Structures).
